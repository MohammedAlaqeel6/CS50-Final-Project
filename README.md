##### Ezinvaders Game Description: ‎
In this project I chose to develop a fighting game as a person interested in video games in order to improve my ‎technical skills.‎‏ ‏
This game consists of two parties, the first party are the invaders who storming the player's land and the second ‎party is the cannon (Shooter) that the player uses to protect his land from invaders, and it’s has been developed ‎by using Visual basic language by identifying a public class and private subs with if statement through Microsoft ‎Visual studio to programming the game on the following scenarios:‎

##### •	The main scenario (Won the game):‎
‎1-‎	The user will click the game.‎
‎2-‎	The app will start the game.‎
‎3-‎	The user clicks right and left buttons to ‎direct the cannon to the invaders.‎
‎4-‎	The app will redirect the cannon based on the user directions.‎
‎5-‎	The user clicks the keyboard space button to shoot the invaders.‎
‎6-‎	The cannon will fire bullets at the invaders.‎
‎7-‎	If all the invaders are killed, the app will display a notification “the land is saved”.‎
‎8-‎	The user will click “OK”.‎
‎9-‎	The app will display a notification “Do you want to play again?”.‎
‎10-‎	If the user clicks “Yes” the app will start the game again, if the user click “No” the app will close the ‎game window.‎

##### •	The alternative scenario (Losing the game):‎
‎1-‎	The user will click the game.‎
‎2-‎	The app will start the game.‎
‎3-‎	The user clicks right and left buttons to ‎direct the cannon to the invaders.‎
‎4-‎	The app will redirect the cannon based on the user directions.‎
‎5-‎	The user clicks the keyboard space button to shoot the invaders.‎
‎6-‎	The cannon will fire bullets at the invaders.‎
‎7-‎	If not all the invaders killed, the app will display a notification “Game Over”.‎
‎8-‎	The user will click “OK”.‎
‎9-‎	The app will display a notification “Do you want to play again?”.‎
‎10-‎	If the user clicks “Yes” the app will start the game again, if the user click “No” the app will close the ‎game window.‎
